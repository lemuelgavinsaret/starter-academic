abstract: The null geodesic equations in the Alcubierre warp drive space-time are numerically integrated to determine light propagation and angular deflection of photons originating from infinity that collide with the warp drive distortion. We find that for a distant observer in a co-moving reference frame alongside the warp drive distortion, light rays colliding with the warp drive would have resulting angular deflections that changes for different values of the impact parameter and warp velocity. Meanwhile, images that propagate through the warp drive distortion would experience gravitational lensing that would invert a radial area of the image from the center outward as seen by an observer following the said warp drive. This lensing effect is caused by the negative energy density matter that supports the warp drive space-time.
