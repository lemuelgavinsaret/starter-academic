I am a Filipino graduate student in the National Institute of Physics, University of the Philippines, Diliman, currently affiliated with the institute's very own Gravity Group led by Dr. [Ian Vega](https://ianvega.wixsite.com/ianvega). I studied a lot about the properties of the *Alcubierre warp drive,* its effects to its immediate vicinity, and the deflection it causes to incoming photons. Currently, I am immersing myself in the physics of *gravitational waves*. I find myself doing all sorts of things in my free time, ranging from more relaxed activities, such as binge watching kdramas and playing board games, to more active ones, such as playing ultimate frisbee and swimming.
