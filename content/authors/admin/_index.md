I am a graduate student in the National Institute of Physics, University of the Philippines, Diliman, currently affiliated with the institute's very own Gravity Group. I studied a lot about the properties of the *Alcubierre warp drive* and its effects to incoming photons. Currently, I'm immersing myself in the physics of *gravitational waves*. I find myself doing all sorts of things in my free time, ranging from more relaxed activities, such as binge watching kdramas and playing board games, to more active ones, such as playing ultimate frisbee and swimming.
