I am an MS Physics graduate from the National Institute of Physics, University of the Philippines, Diliman, and a member of the Gravity Group led by Dr. [Ian Vega](https://ianvega.wixsite.com/ianvega). As a student-researcher, I was particularly interested in unraveling the intricacies of our universe, specifically through studying the properties of an Alcubierre warp drive and its influence on the trajectories of light, and most recently, the dynamics of a compact object orbiting around a supermassive black hole.  I find myself doing all sorts of things in my free time, ranging from more relaxed activities, such as binge watching shows and playing board games, to more active ones, such as playing ultimate frisbee and swimming.
