I am a graduate student in the National Institute of Physics, University of the Philippines, Diliman, and a member of the Gravity Group led by Dr. [Ian Vega](https://ianvega.wixsite.com/ianvega). As an undergrad, I spent several years studying the properties of the Alcubierre warp drive, its effects to its immediate vicinity, and the deflection it causes to incoming photons. I wrote my undergraduate thesis and several conference proceedings papers based on this work. As a Master's student, I am focused on gravitational wave physics, particularly the dynamics of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals. I find myself doing all sorts of things in my free time, ranging from more relaxed activities, such as binge watching kdramas and playing board games, to more active ones, such as playing ultimate frisbee and swimming.
